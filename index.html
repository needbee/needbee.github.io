          Did you know what you wanted to be when you grew up? Ever since Melissa Joan Hart made video games about her annoying little brother on <i>Clarissa Explains It All</i>, I knew I wanted to be a software developer. I love that I get the chance to do that all week. Software development, not making games about Melissa Joan Hart's brother.

          I've been writing software full-time for eleven years, working in technologies ranging from Java to PHP to Ruby to Objective-C. I've built many small and large web applications, including e-commerce systems, wikis, and intelligent search algorithms. I work anywhere between implementing and styling rich UIs back through building robust database schemas and web service client/server architectures.
          </p>

          <p>
          I try to always be learning more about best practices and time-proven techniques. In addition to my computer science degree, I like to read great books on software engineering both classics and modern, like <i>Professional Software Development</i>, <i>The Pragmatic Programmer</i>, and <i>Code Complete</i>. I enjoy attending conferences and reading blog posts on development.

          My clients consistently say that I analyze needs precisely, I communicate technical concepts in language non-technical people can understand, I write reliable software, I keep them well-informed of progress, and I deliver on time.
