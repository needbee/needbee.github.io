          Did you know what you wanted to be when you grew up? Ever since Melissa Joan Hart made video games about her annoying little brother on <i>Clarissa Explains It All</i>, I knew I wanted to be a software developer. I'm so excited to get the chance to do that all week. Software development, not making games about Melissa Joan Hart's brother.
          </p>

          <p>
          I've been writing software full-time for eleven years, working in technologies ranging from Java to PHP to Ruby to Objective-C. I've built many small and large web applications, including e-commerce systems, wikis, and intelligent search algorithms.
          </p>

          <p>
          I try to always be learning more about best practices and time-proven techniques. In addition to my computer science degree, I like to read great books on software engineering both classics and modern, like <i>Professional Software Development</i>, <i>The Pragmatic Programmer</i>, and <i>Code Complete</i>. I enjoy attending conferences and reading blog posts on development.

            <li>
              <h3>Engineering</h3>
              <p>Taking the craft of writing software seriously by applying principles that have been discovered over the decades, focusing on meeting needs, and writing code that will flex under the changes that come over time.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Visibility</h3>
              <p>Helping all team members (developers, project managers, and clients) see at all times how a project is intended to proceed, how it's actually proceeding, and what can be done to adjust to meet client goals.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Tooling</h3>
              <p>Finding or creating solutions to boilerplate problems so teams can focus on solving the problems that add value for their clients, instead of reinventing the wheel.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Sharing</h3>
              <p>Writing reusable code, externalizing it in packages, and open-sourcing it whenever possible.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Training</h3>
              <p>Helping development teams better learn their craft, and helping them decide together how they want to operate as a team to increase effectiveness.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
          My clients consistently say that I analyze needs precisely, I communicate technical concepts in language non-technical people can understand, I write reliable software, I keep them well-informed of progress, and I deliver on time.
